# big_data_project
The project is developed based on a data set of video game sales with other factors such as platform, released years, publisher, scoring, rating and so on. The data set is from Kaggle, while the original data is from Metacritic. The project’s decision is whether the sale of a new released game in the different areas will exceed the average sales amount in the area of other games. The advantage of the decision is to maximize the profit and sales. The project’s insight is to predict the probability of new released games to exceed the average sales in different areas.

The procedures for our project are: 
  Data Acquisition 
  Data Exploration
  Missing Value Imputation
  Convert Sales to Categorical value with Average
  Variable Transformation 
  Data Partition
  Use Different Model to test the data
  Create new data to compare
